# Timmy, Cave Explorer

Timmy is trapped in a cave! He was exploring near his grandparents’ farm and discovered a cave, but now he is lost inside, and things are getting pretty weird. Strange, glow-in-the-dark fungi is growing in the cave, so he can see.

There are strange, aggressive bats. Fortunately, Tim, brought along his pellet pistol so he can defend himself. The bats are dropping “things” down at him. There also  may be other strange creatures attacking from above.

Help Timmy defend himself!
